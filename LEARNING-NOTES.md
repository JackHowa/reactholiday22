# Day 1

This is experimental. Don't assume prod behavior but still learning next. I like that experimental features are opt-in though:

`npx create-next-app@latest --experimental-app`

- name the repo after this command
- opted out of ts
- opted into eslint

```

warn  - You have enabled experimental feature (appDir) in next.config.js.
warn  - Experimental features are not covered by semver, and may cause unexpected or broken application behavior. Use at your own risk.
info  - Thank you for testing `appDir` please leave your feedback at https://nextjs.link/app-feedback
```

`app` directory requires node 16.
